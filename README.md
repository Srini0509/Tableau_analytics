## Black friday sales data Analysis with Tableau
Here I tried to understand the retail Consumer behaviour in Black friday sales by considering 6 important features using interactive visual dashboards (Link provided below)

Dataset of 550000 observations x 12 features about the black Friday in a retail store, it contains different kinds of variables either numerical or categorical.

### Data description from Kaggle
The dataset here is a sample of the transactions made in a retail store. The store wants to know better the customer purchase behaviour against different products. Specifically, here the problem is a regression problem where we are trying to predict the dependent variable (the amount of purchase) with the help of the information contained in the other variables. Classification problem can also be settled in this dataset since several variables are categorical, and some other approaches could be "Predicting the age of the consumer" or even "Predict the category of goods bought". This dataset is also particularly convenient for clustering and maybe find different clusters of consumers within it.
