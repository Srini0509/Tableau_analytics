## Black friday sales data Analysis with Tableau
Here I tried to understand the retail Consumer behaviour in Black friday sales by considering 6 important features using interactive visual dashboards (Link provided below)

Dataset of 550000 observations x 12 features about the black Friday in a retail store, it contains different kinds of variables either numerical or categorical.

### Data description from Kaggle
The dataset here is a sample of the transactions made in a retail store. The store wants to know better the customer purchase behaviour against different products. Specifically, here the problem is a regression problem where we are trying to predict the dependent variable (the amount of purchase) with the help of the information contained in the other variables. Classification problem can also be settled in this dataset since several variables are categorical, and some other approaches could be "Predicting the age of the consumer" or even "Predict the category of goods bought". This dataset is also particularly convenient for clustering and maybe find different clusters of consumers within it.

### This Tableau visual compares Gender, City, Age, Marital status with Purchase of Top 29 Products

### Interesting Consumer Behavioural Understanding
 * Males are the major consumer
 * Unmarried Males with the age group 26 to 35 are the dominant purchaser in Unmarried status
 * By ranking consumers in city wise B scores greatest, then C and then A the least
 * When noticing unmarried sect 18-36 age group are the second or third larger contributors, Whereas in the married sect this differs.
 * It seems like married consumers spent little money, which is logical. Particularly when analysing married 18-25 age group, noticed      that only meagre amount was spent, who is the second major contributor in unmarried sector
 * Also purchase of 46-55 age group increased after marriage
 * The consumers who are staying for a year buy a lot than 2 year and 3 year consumers. Infact year of stay decrease the purchase except    for guest
 * While analysing the occupation overall the occupation no:4 is the potential purchaser. The 2nd highest is occupation 0 (might be        unemployed-unknown due to privacy. If so it will be the interesting fact)
 * All 26-35 age consumer having occupation 0, except for 3 year stay consumer who is having occupation 17
 * The product P00025442 and P00110742 are the top 2 hit products among the consumers
 
 #### We can still drill down more with data for focussed understanding on the consumer purchase. We can analyse the product interest    with respect to city, gender, marital status and Age group
